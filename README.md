### What is DL Energy Tag Generator?
"DL Energy Tag Generator" is a google chrome extensions for generating energy patterns on your stackoverflow post which deals with energy inefficiency problem.

### Why DL Energy Tag Generator?
In today's world, Deep Leaning Algorithms are exponentially growing ,which leads increase in complexity of algorithms exponentially which leads to huge power consumption which also leads to greenhouse gas emmissions so our extension would help user in finding solution to his problem by considering the relevant energy inefficiency problem present in it's problem so user answering the question would consider these tags so energy could be optimized. 

### Get Started
Before starting the below requirements, install python>=3.12.0 and pip from https://www.python.org/downloads/

1. Clone the repository https://github.com/krish10924/DL-Energy-Tag-Generator by using the following bash command:
   
   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/krish10924/DL-Energy-Tag-Generator
   ```
2. load the extension in google chrome by going to "chrome://extensions" then enable the developers option and now on clicking the load unpacked option you could add the required project . And now successfully a extension with name "Deep_L Tag
" is successfully loaded.

4. Finally, run the application by the following python command:

   ```cd server
   python3 backend.py ```
Open your browser and start surfing stackoverflow posts and it would generate the required energy patterns onto your stackoverflow post
